    North Carolina State University is a public research university in the United States. This 4 week long immersive campus opportunity is an intensive research skills program. The participants will be assigned to existing research teams, and finish a small task during these 4 weeks. The participants will present at a poster symposium upon their successful completion of their research accomplishment at the end of this program. The participants will gain research experience, and learn how to communicate with diverse teams. We will issue the graduation certificate and evaluation letter to the participants. This is a very valuable opportunity for students who are interested in research.
